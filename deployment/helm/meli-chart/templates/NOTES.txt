This will configure the Meli admin server to run at:

https://{{ .Values.ingress.domain }}

It will also direct `cert-manager` to issue certificates for:

https://*.{{ .Values.ingress.domain }}
{{ range $index, $site := .Values.ingress.sites }}
https://*.{{ $site }}.{{ $.Values.ingress.domain }}
{{ end }}

The Meli deployment will pick up any additional environment variables
from the secret `deployment-env`.  This is where you should put any
"secrets" like authentication client secrets, passwords, etc.  You are 
also free to put any other less confidential information in there as well.
But, this is where you should put authentication related 
configuration variables like `MELI_PASSWORD`, or `MELI_GITLAB_*`.

At a minimum, you will be required to provide:

- `MELI_PASSWORD`
- `MELI_JWT_SECRET`
- `MELI_MONGO_PASSWORD` (if MongoDB is enabled)
- `MELI_ROOT_MONGO_PASSWORD` (ditto)
