## How it works

1. Sign-in and create your organization
1. Create a site in your dashboard, say `my-site`
1. Upload a release with the `@getmeli/meli` CLI
1. Setup `my-domain.com` to point to your Meli server at `my-site.mymeli.com`

## Development

### Start UI

1. Clone the [UI repo](https://github.com/getmeli/meli-ui).
1. `npm i && npm start`
1. The app is accessible from http://localhost:3001, but we develop from http://localhost:80 (see below)

### Start Caddy and the API

1. Run `docker-compose -f ./docker-compose-dev.yml up -d`
1. Configure your `.env` (copy `.env.example` to start with)
1. Run `npm i && npm start`

If you develop with the UI, you'll need to clone the [UI repo](https://github.com/getmeli/meli-ui), then start it.

You can now browse at `http://localhost:80`:
- `http://localhost:80/` => UI
- `http://localhost:80/api`, `http://localhost:80/auth` and `http://localhost:80/socket.io` => API
- `http://loopback.sh` => your sites will be served here

### DNS config

You need to configure your machine to allow wildcard domains for development. We've got a few ways to do this.

#### Use loopback.sh

We've configured loopback.sh to point to 127.0.0.1, so you can develop with it. Update your `.env`.

```
MELI_SITES_URL=loopback.sh
```

Your sites will be served at `*.loopback.sh`.

Pros: simple, no config required
Cons: you need to be connected to the internet

#### Using /etc/hosts

Unfortunately, /etc/hosts doesn't support wildcard domains, so you'll need to edit /etc/hosts for every site added to Meli:

```
127.0.0.1 my-site.test
127.0.0.1 my-channel.my-site.test
```

Pros: simple, can develop without internet
Cons: have to reconfigure every time you add a site

#### Using dnsmasq

```
brew install dnsmasq

# tell dsnmasq to point *.test to 127.0.0.1
echo "address=/test/127.0.0.1" > /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf

# start daemon
brew services start dnsmasq

# make OSX point to dnsmasq
sudo mkdir -p /etc/resolver

# tell os x to point *.test to 127.0.0.1
sudo echo "nameserver 127.0.0.1" > /etc/resolver/test

ping hello.test
```

Your sites will be served at `*.test`.

Pros: you don't need to be connected to the internet, no need to reconfigure /etc/hosts
Cons: a bit complex, config required
